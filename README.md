# Interpreter timer
<br><br>
A simple app created to divide the timeslots for turnover in the interpreters' both.<br>
This basic version simply prints out the periods of time each interpreter will work, according to a block of time to be determined by the interpreters (usually from 15 to 30 minutes).<br>
Future versions will include a GUI, the possibility to choose between 12-hour or 24-hour format, and the possitibility to account for lunch/coffee breaks.
